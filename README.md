# Angular Workbox Starter Kit

## Create Angular Project

1. First we can create new Angular Project with Angular-CLI with command: `ng new web`

2. Install dependencies (if not automated) with `npm i` or `yarn install`

3. Try running build for first time with command: `npm run build`
   It will create new folder `./dist` as our output result.
